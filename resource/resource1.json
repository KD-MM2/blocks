One day, his advisors\n              came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.\n            </p>\n            <h2>The King&apos;s Plan</h2>\n            <p>\n              The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"#\">a brilliant plan</a>: he would tax the jokes in the\n              kingdom.\n            </p>\n            <blockquote>\n              &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everyone enjoys a good\n              joke, so it&apos;s only fair that they should pay for the\n              privilege.&rdquo;\n            </blockquote>\n            <h3>The Joke Tax</h3>\n            <p>\n              The king&apos;s subjects were not amused. They grumbled and\n              complained, but the king was firm:\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>\n              <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>\n              <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>\n              As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell\n              into a gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the\n              king&apos;s foolishness get him down: a court jester named\n              Jokester.\n            </p>\n            <h3>Jokester&apos;s Revolt</h3>\n            <p>\n              Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night\n              and leaving jokes all over the place: under the king&apos;s\n              pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was\n              furious, but he couldn&apos;t seem to stop Jokester.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the\n              jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn&apos;t help\n              but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn&apos;t\n              stop.\n            </p>\n            <h3>The People&apos;s Rebellion</h3>\n            <p>\n              The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter,\n              started to tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom\n              was in on the joke.\n            </p>\n            <div>\n              <table>\n                <thead>\n                  <tr>\n                    <th>King&apos;s Treasury</th>\n                    <th>People&apos;s happiness</th>\n                  </tr>\n                </thead>\n                <tbody>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>Empty</td>\n                    <td>Overflowing</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr className=\"even:bg-muted m-0 border-t p-0\">\n                    <td>Modest</td>\n                    <td>Satisfied</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr className=\"even:bg-muted m-0 border-t p-0\">\n                    <td>Full</td>\n                    <td>Ecstatic</td>\n                  </tr>\n                </tbody>\n              </table>\n            </div>\n            <p>\n              The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the\n              error of his ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared\n              a hero, and the kingdom lived happily ever after.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good\n              laugh and always be careful of bad ideas.\n            </p>\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n};\n\nexport { Resource1 };\n"
