One day, his advisors\n                came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of\n                money.\n              </p>\n              <h2>The King&apos;s Plan</h2>\n              <p>\n                The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{\" \"}\n                <a href=\"#\">a brilliant plan</a>: he would tax the jokes in the\n                kingdom.\n              </p>\n              <blockquote>\n                &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everyone enjoys a good\n                joke, so it&apos;s only fair that they should pay for the\n                privilege.&rdquo;\n              </blockquote>\n              <h3>The Joke Tax</h3>\n              <p>\n                The king&apos;s subjects were not amused. They grumbled and\n                complained, but the king was firm:\n              </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>\n                <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>\n                <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>\n              </ul>\n              <p>\n                As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell\n                into a gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the\n                king&apos;s foolishness get him down: a court jester named\n                Jokester.\n              </p>\n              <h3>Jokester&apos;s Revolt</h3>\n              <p>\n                Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the\n                night and leaving jokes all over the place: under the\n                king&apos;s pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The\n                king was furious, but he couldn&apos;t seem to stop Jokester.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the\n                jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn&apos;t\n                help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they\n                couldn&apos;t stop.\n              </p>\n              <h3>The People&apos;s Rebellion</h3>\n              <p>\n                The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter,\n                started to tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire\n                kingdom was in on the joke.\n              </p>\n              <div>\n                <table>\n                  <thead>\n                    <tr>\n                      <th>King&apos;s Treasury</th>\n                      <th>People&apos;s happiness</th>\n                    </tr>\n                  </thead>\n                  <tbody>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>Empty</td>\n                      <td>Overflowing</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr className=\"even:bg-muted m-0 border-t p-0\">\n                      <td>Modest</td>\n                      <td>Satisfied</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr className=\"even:bg-muted m-0 border-t p-0\">\n                      <td>Full</td>\n                      <td>Ecstatic</td>\n                    </tr>\n                  </tbody>\n                </table>\n              </div>\n              <p>\n                The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized\n                the error of his ways and repealed the joke tax.
